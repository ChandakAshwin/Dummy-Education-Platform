                                             PROJECTILE MOTION
Projectile motion is a form of motion experienced by an object or particle (a projectile) that is thrown near the Earth's surface and moves 
along a curved path under the action of gravity only (in particular, the effects of air resistance are assumed to be negligible). This curved 
path was shown by Galileo to be a parabola. The study of such motions is called ballistics, and such a trajectory is a ballistic trajectory. 
The only force of significance that acts on the object is gravity, which acts downward, thus imparting to the object a downward acceleration. 
Because of the object's inertia, no external horizontal force is needed to maintain the horizontal velocity component of the object. Taking other 
forces into account, such as friction from aerodynamic drag or internal propulsion such as in a rocket, requires additional analysis. A ballistic 
missile is a missile only guided during the relatively brief initial powered phase of flight, and whose subsequent course is governed by the laws 
of classical mechanics.
Ballistics (greek ('ba'llein'), "to throw") is the science of mechanics that deals with the flight, behavior, and effects of projectiles, 
especially bullets, unguided bombs, rockets, or the like; the science or art of designing and accelerating projectiles so as to achieve a desired 
performance.
The elementary equations of ballistics neglect nearly every factor except for initial velocity and an assumed constant gravitational acceleration. 
Practical solutions of a ballistics problem often require considerations of air resistance, cross winds, target motion, varying acceleration due to 
gravity, and in such problems as launching a rocket from one point on the Earth to another, the rotation of the Earth. Detailed mathematical 
solutions of practical problems typically do not have closed-form solutions, and therefore require numerical methods to address.

Few Examples of  Two – Dimensional Projectiles

Throwing a ball or a cannonball
The motion of a billiard ball on the billiard table.
A motion of a shell fired from a gun.
A motion of a boat in a river.
The motion of the earth around the sun.
When a particle is projected obliquely near the earth's surface, it moves simultaneously in the direction of horizontal and vertical. 
The motion of such a particle is called Projectile Motion. In the above diagram, where a particle is projected at an angle , with an 
initial velocity u. For this particular case, we will calculate the following:

The time is taken to reach point A from O
The horizontal distance covered (OA)
The maximum height reached during the motion.
The velocity at any time " t " during the motion.
