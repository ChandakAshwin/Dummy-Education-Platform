Brief Intro: Introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) will indeed be an important perfection and the next logical step towards a widespread 
indirect tax reforms in India.
What is GST?
'G' _ Goods  'S' _ Services  'T' _ Tax
"Goods and Service Tax (GST) is a comprehensive tax levy on manufacture, sale and consumption of goods and service at a national level under which no 
distinction is made between goods and services for levying of tax.
 Rate of GST:
There would be two-rate structure _a lower rate for necessary items and items of basic importance and a standard rate for goods in general. There will
 also be a special rate for precious metals and a list of exempted items. For goods in general, government is considering pegging the rate of GST from 20%
 to 23% that is well above the global average rate of 16.4% for similar taxes, however below the revenue neutral rate of 27%.
Model of GST with example:

The GST shall have two components: one levied by the Centre (referred to as Central GST or CGST), and the other levied by the States 
(referred to as State GST or SGST). Rates for Central GST and State GST would beapproved appropriately, reflecting revenue considerations and acceptability.
The CGST and the SGST would be applicable to all transactions of goods and services made for a consideration except the exempted goods and services.
Cross utilization of ITC both in case of Inputs and capital goods between the CGST and the SGST would not be permitted except in the case of inter-State
 supply of goods and services (i.e. IGST).
The Centre and the States would have concurrent jurisdiction for the entire value chain and for all taxpayers on the basis of thresholds for goods 
and services prescribed for the States and the Centre.

Example _2 (Input Tax Credit)

Shiva, a registered dealer had input tax credit for CGST and SGST Rs.750/- and Rs.1,050/- respectively in respect of purchase of inputs and capital goods.
 He manufactured 1800 liters of finished products. 200 liters was normal loss in the process. The final product was sold at uniform price of Rs.10 per liter as follows:-

Goods sold within State _ 800 liter.

Finished product sold in inter-State sale _ 650 liter.

Goods sent on stock transfer to consignment agents outside the State _ 350 liter.

Further, CGST and SGST rate on the finished product of dealer is 5% and 7% respectively. Further IGST rate is 12%.Calculate tax liability of SGST and CGST

CGST	400	_	350	750
SGST	_	560	490	1050
Balance Payable	_	_	360	360 
Notes:

There would be no treatment for normal loss.
Input tax credit of CGST and SGST of Rs. 750 and Rs. 1050 are paid on inputs. This input tax credit should first be utilized for payment of CGST and SGST,
 respectively, and balance is to be used for payment of IGST. Thus, balance available for payment of IGST is Rs. 350 of CGST and Rs. 490 of SGST and he is 
liable to pay balance amount of IGST of Rs. 360 by cash (1200-350-490 = 360). Since credit of SGST of Rs.490 has been utilized for payment of IGST, the State
 Government will get debit of Rs. 490 from the Central Government.
Example _3 (Input Tax Credit)

Now, continuing with the above example 2, suppose the dealer purchases goods interstate and have input tax credit of IGST available is Rs.2,000/-. 
Compute the tax payable.
