Trigonometry
To find the distances and heights we can use the mathematical techniques, which come under the Trigonometry. It shows the relationship between the
 sides and the angles of the triangle. Generally, it is used in the case of a right angle triangle.

Trigonometric Ratios
Right angle triangleIn a right angle triangle, the ratio of its side and the acute angles is the trigonometric ratios of the angles.

In this right angle triangle QB = 90°. If we take QA as acute angle then -

AB is the base, as the side adjacent to the acute angle.                        C|\
                                                                                 | \ 
BC is the perpendicular, as the side opposite to the acute angle.                |  \
                                                                                 |   \
Ac is the hypotenuse, as the side opposite to the right angle.                   |_   \
                                                                                B|_|___\A
Trigonometric ratios with respect to QA                                          

Ratio	Formula	                     Short form	Value
sin A	{Perpendicular}/{hypotenuse}	P/H	BC/AC
cos A	{Base}/{hypotenuse}	        B/H	AB/AC
tan A	{Perpendicular}/{base}   	P/B	BC/AB
cosec A	{Hypotenuse}/{perpendicular}	H/P	AC/BC
sec A	{Hypotenuse}/{base}	        H/B	AC/AB
cot A	{Base}/{perpendicular}   	B/P	AB/BC
Remark

If we take QC as acute angle then BC will be base and AB will be perpendicular. Hypotenuse remains the same i.e. AC.So the ratios will be 
according to that only.
If the angle is same then the value of the trigonometric ratios of the angles remain the same whether the length of the side increases or decreases.
In a right angle triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side so sin A or cos A will always be less than or equal to 1 and the value of sec A or
 cosec A will always be greater than or equal to 1.
Reciprocal Relation between Trigonometric Ratios
Cosec A, sec A, and cot A are the reciprocals of sin A, cos A, and tan A respectively.

sin Q = 1/cosec Q 
cos Q = 1/sec Q

Use of Trigonometric Ratios and Table in Solving Problems
Example

Find the lengths of the sides BC and AC in Q ABC, right-angled at B where AB = 25 cm and QACB = 30°, using trigonometric ratios.

Right-angled

Solution

To find the length of the side BC, we need to choose the ratio having BC and the given side AB. As we can see that BC is the side adjacent to angle
C and AB is the side opposite to angle C, therefore

tan c

tan 30°

Side adjacent

BC = 25v3 cm

To find the length of the side AC, we consider

sin 30°

AC = 50 cm

Trigonometric Ratios of Complementary Angles
If the sum of two angles is 90° then, it is called Complementary Angles. In a right-angled triangle, one angle is 90 °, so the sum of the other
two angles is also 90° or they are complementary angles.so the trigonometric ratios of the complementary angles will be -

sin (90° – A) = cos A,

cos (90° – A) = sin A,

tan (90° – A) = cot A,

cot (90° – A) = tan A,

sec (90° – A) = cosec A,

cosec (90° – A) = sec A

Trigonometric Identities (Pythagoras Identity)
An equation is said to be a trigonometric identity if it contains trigonometric ratios of an angle and satisfies it for all values of the given 
trigonometric ratios.

Trigonometric Identities

In QPQR, right angled at Q, we can say that


PQ2 + QR2 = PR2

Divide each term by PR2, we get

Divide each term by PR2

 (sin R)2 + (cos R)2 = 1

sin2 R + cos2 R =1

Likewise other trigonometric identities can also be proved. So the identities are-

sin2 R + cos2 R = 1

1 + tan2 R = sec2 R

cot2 R + 1 = cosec2 R
