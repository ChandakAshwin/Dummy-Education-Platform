1.  The S.I. unit of force is
         I. Kgm/s
        II. Kgm/s2
       III. Newton
       IV. Newton-meter

2.  What do we get by the product of mass and velocity?
         I. Force
        II. Inertia
       III. Momentum
       IV. Newton

3.  The rate of change of momentum of an object is proportional to
         I. Mass of the body
        II. Velocity of the body
       III. Net force applied on the body
       IV. None of these

4.  If two balls of same masses are dropped on sand, the depths of penetration is same if
         I. Heavier ball is dropped faster than lighter ball
        II. Lighter ball is dropped faster than heavier ball
       III. The product ‘mv’ is same for both bodies
       IV. None of these

5.  A coin placed on a card(rested at the edges of the glass) remains at rest because of
         I. Inertia of rest
        II. Two forces act on the coin which balance each other
       III. No unbalanced force acts on it
       IV. All of these

6.  A force of 50N moves a body,
         I. Friction force exerted on the body is less than 50N
        II. Friction force exerted on the body is more than 50N
       III. None of these
       IV. Both of I and II

7.  A fielder giving a swing while catching a ball is an example of
         I. Inertia
        II. Momentum
       III. Newton’s II law of motion
       IV. Newton’s I law of motion

8.  Action and reaction forces
         I. Act on the same body
        II. Act on different bodies
       III. Act in same direction
       IV. Both I and III

9.  When we pedaling the bicycle it stops because
         I. The earth’s gravitational force acts on it
        II. It is not accelerated
       III. No unbalanced force acts on it
       IV. Frictional force acts on it

10.  A football and a stone has same mass
         I. Both have same inertia
        II. Both have same momentum
       III. Both have different inertia
       IV. Both have different momentum
