Question 1: Which of the following pieces of data does not uniquely determine an acute angled triangle ABC (where R is the radius of the circumcircle)? (2002)

1. a, sin A, sin B                                                  2. a, b, c

3. a, sin B, R                                                       4. a, sin A, R

Answer: We shall discuss all the four parts one by one.

1. When a, sin A, sin B are given it becomes possible to find the rest of the sides as

b = a sin B/ sin A,                               

c = a sin C/ sin A

So, all the three sides are unique.

2. The three sides can uniquely make an acute angled triangle.

3. a, sin B, R is given and so the data is sufficient for computing the remaining sides and triangles.  

b = 2R sin B, sin A = a sin B/b

So, sin C can be determined. Hence, this also implies that the side c can be uniquely determined.

4. a, sin A, R is given, data is insufficient to find the other sides and angles

b/ sin B = c/ sin C = 2R

Hence, it is clear that this could not determine the exact values of a and b.

Question 2:  Consider a triangle ABC and let a, b and c denote the lengths of the sides opposite to vertices A, B and C respectively. Suppose, a = 6, b = 10 and the area of the triangle is 15√3. If ACB is obtuse and if r denotes the radius of the incircle of the triangle, then find the value of r2. (2010)

Answer: The two sides ‘a’ and ‘b’ of the triangle are given to be 6 and 10 respectively.

Now, sin C = √3/2 and C is given to be obtuse

This gives C = 2π/3 = √(a2 + b2 - 2ab cos C)

                      = √62 + 102 – 2.6.10. cos 2π /3

                      = 14

Hence, r = ?/s which means

Question 3: If ? is the area of triangle with sides of length a, b and c then show that ? ≤ 1/4 √ (a+b+c) abc. Also show that the equality occurs in the above inequality if and only if a = b = c. (2001)

Answer: The area of the triangle is ? and the lengths of the sides are a, b and c.

Now, it is given that ? ≤ 1/4 √(a+b+c) abc

Hence, 1/4?. √(a+b+c) abc ≥ 1

So, (a+b+c) abc /16?2 ≥ 1

Hence, 2sabc/ 16?2 ≥ 1

So, sabc/ 8s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) ≥ 1
Question 1: If cos (a + b) = 4/5, sin (a-b) = 5/13 and a and b lie between 0 to π/4, find tan 2a.

Answer: It is given that cos (a + b) = 4/5, sin (a-b) = 5/13

It follows that sin (a + b) = 3/5, cos (a-b) = 12/13

Hence, tan (a+b) = 3/4 and tan (a-b) = 5/12

Hence, this implies

tan [(a+b) + a-b] =[tan (a+b) + tan (a-b)]/ [1 + tan(a+b)tan(a-b)]

= (3/4 + 5/12)/ (1 – 3/4. 5/12)

Hence, tan 2a = 14/12. 48/33 = 56/33.

Question 2: If A + B + C = 1800, prove that

sin (B + C – A) + sin (C + A – B) + sin (A + B – C) = 4 sin A sin B sin C.

Answer:We have

sin (B + C – A) + sin (C + A – B) + sin (A + B – C) = 4 sin A sin B sin C

So consider LHS = sin (B + C – A) + sin (C + A – B) + sin (A + B – C)

= sin (π– A – A) + sin (π – B – B) + sin (π– C – C)(since A + B + C = π)

= sin 2A + sin 2B + sin 2C

= 4 sin A sin B sin C 

Question 3: Solve the equation 5 sinθ – 2 cos2θ – 1 = 0 

Answer: Given, 5 sinθ – 2 cos2θ – 1 = 0 

or,5 sinθ – 2 (1 – sin2θ) – 1 = 0 

or,2 sin2 θ + 5 sin θ – 3 = 0 

or,(sin θ + 3) (2 sin θ – 1) = 0 

∴sin θ = 3 or, sin θ = 1/2 

if sin θ = 3

This is not possible as range of sine is [–1, 1]    

If sin θ = 1/2                                  

or, sin θ = sin π/6 

⇒ θ = n π + (–1)n π/6 

where n = 0, ±1, ±2 ……  
abc/ 8(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) ≥ 1

Hence, abc/ 8 ≥ (s-a)(s-b)(s-c)

Now, put (s-a) = x ≥ 0, (s-b) = y ≥ 0, (s-c) = z ≥ 0

Hence, (s-a) + (s-b) = x + y

So, this gives 2x – a – b = x + y

So, c = x + y

Similarly, as a = y + z, b = x + z, so we get,

(x+y)/2. (y+z)/2. (x+z)/2 ≥ xyz which is true

Now equality will hold only if x = y = z i.e. only if a = b = c.

So, the equality will hold only if the triangle is equilateral.
